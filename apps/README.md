# Sample apps

Create sub directories here for each application. Each directory should contain the files that make up your application. You can use any technology you like to develop your applications, but you must provide a Cloud Foundry manifest file named `manifest.yml`. This Cloud Foundry file describes how to deploy to and run your application in the IBM Cloud.
